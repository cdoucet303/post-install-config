<h2>Post-Install Configuration Objectives </h2>

- Configure Roles (For Grouping Permissions)
- Configure Departments
  

<p>
When we have our osTicket open the first thing we want to do is Click admin panel in the top right so we can configure all the permissions and rules like Roles, Departments, Teams, Agents, Users, and SLA (Service Level Agreement). When you click admin panel your screen should change and put you in the settings and the admin panel button now says Agent panel button.

The first Configuration I am going to demonstrate is Roles. In the same row as settings select Agents and click Add New Agent. Now here is where an Agent is added and you would add the employees information, access, and permissons. From here you can select what permission or access they have to the ticketing system. You can even assign them to certain teams which we will be creating later. This is useful for reasons like if you need this employee to be an admin and oversee and edit Users and Groups and Permissions or maybe this is a brand new employee who should only see and work on tickets assigned to them or their team.
